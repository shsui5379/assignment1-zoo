        Rabbits, also known as bunnies or bunny rabbits, are small mammals in the family Leporidae (which also includes
        the hares), which is in the order Lagomorpha (which also includes the pikas). Oryctolagus cuniculus is the
        European rabbit, including its descendants, the world's 305 breeds of domestic rabbit. Sylvilagus includes 13
        wild rabbit species, among them the seven types of cottontail. The European rabbit, which has been introduced on
        every continent except Antarctica, is familiar throughout the world as a wild prey animal, a domesticated form
        of livestock and a pet. With its widespread effect on ecologies and cultures, in many areas of the world, the
        rabbit is a part of daily life â€“ as food, clothing, a companion, and a source of artistic inspiration. Although
        once considered rodents, lagomorphs like rabbits have been discovered to have diverged separately and earlier
        than their rodent cousins and have a number of traits rodents lack, including two extra incisors.
