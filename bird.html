        Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class Aves (/ˈeɪviːz/), characterised by
        feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart,
        and a strong yet lightweight skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5.5 cm (2.2 in) bee
        hummingbird to the 2.8 m (9 ft 2 in) common ostrich. There are over 11,000 living species, more than half of
        which are passerine, or "perching" birds. Birds have wings whose development varies according to species; the
        only known groups without wings are the extinct moa and elephant birds. Wings, which are modified forelimbs,
        gave birds the ability to fly, although further evolution has led to the loss of flight in some birds, including
        ratites, penguins, and diverse endemic island species. The digestive and respiratory systems of birds are also
        uniquely adapted for flight. Some bird species of aquatic environments, particularly seabirds and some
        waterbirds, have further evolved for swimming. The study of birds is called ornithology.
