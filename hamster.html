        Hamsters are more crepuscular than nocturnal and, in the wild, remain underground during the day to avoid being
        caught by predators. They feed primarily on seeds, fruits, and vegetation, and will occasionally eat burrowing
        insects. Physically, they are stout-bodied with distinguishing features that include elongated cheek pouches
        extending to their shoulders, which they use to carry food back to their burrows, as well as a short tail and
        fur-covered feet.
